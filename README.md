## Overview

### The challenge

- Create todo items as objects with properties such as title, description, due date, and priority.
- Implement projects or separate lists of todos.
- Allow users to create new projects and assign todos to specific projects.
- Separate application logic from DOM-related stuff by using modules.
- Design a user interface to:
  - View all projects.
  - View all todos in each project, displaying title and due date, possibly with color-coded priorities.
  - Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.
  - Delete a todo.
- Consider using external libraries like date-fns for date manipulation.
- Add persistence to the app using the Web Storage API, specifically localStorage.
- Ensure the app handles cases where data from localStorage may not be present.
- Store and retrieve data in JSON format, and handle methods associated with objects.
